/**
 * Every table, with the module that owns it (`docs/architecture.md`), its scope and its kind,
 * which decide the conventions it is held to (ADR 0004, ADR 0020).
 *
 * Scope:
 * - `tenant`: tenant data; `tenant_id`, forced RLS, foreign keys to other tenant tables carry it.
 * - `platform`: platform data (people, catalogs, contracts); no `tenant_id`, guarded by the core.
 *
 * Kind:
 * - `business`: `created_at`, `updated_at`, `archived_at`; archived, never deleted.
 * - `append-only`: `created_at` only; a trigger refuses `UPDATE`, `DELETE` and `TRUNCATE`, and the
 *   app role has no such privileges (audit, payments, clinical versions, the sync command log).
 * - `queue`: `created_at` and `updated_at`; rows change as they are processed (outbox, message
 *   status).
 *
 * The convention test fails when a table is missing here or does not follow its scope and kind.
